### Prerequisites

- Neovim version > 0.9.0<br>
  (version of the initial commit is 0.10.0-devXXXX)

### Installation
0. Remove/backup any existing Neovim configurations, that are located in:
   
    `~/.config/nvim`

    `~/.local/share/nvim`
1. Clone this repository into your Neovim configuration directory:

    ```bash

    ```
2. Packer installation

>
> Moreover Install the Solidity language server globally using npm:
>
>    ```bash
>    npm install @ignored/solidity-language-server -g
>    ```
>
> After installation, the language server's standalone executable is available. In the neovim config, I am using the following _command_:
>
>    ```bash
>    nomicfoundation-solidity-language-server --stdio
>    ```
>
>    This command is necessary for the lspconfig to run the Solidity language server correctly.
